API Introduction
================

Notes
-----

While `pheres`'s implementation is organized in modules, the top-level package ``pheres`` contains the entire public API.
To use pheres, the prefix is always just ``pheres`` (e.g. ``pheres.jsonable``).
The only exception to that is the `pheres.types` module, which is intended to import all values used for type-hints at once.

This documentation retains the module architecture to separate the different functionalities of ``pheres`` in a logical manner.
